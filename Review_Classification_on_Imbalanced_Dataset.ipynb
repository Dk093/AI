        "We can see from the output of **value_counts()** and from the image above that our dataset has imbalanced class distribution. This is a scenario where the number of observations belonging to one class is significantly lower than those belonging to the other classes. If the class imbalance is not dealt with, then there is a risk that all the minority classes can be misclassified, and still, the accuracy of the model will be high. For example, in a classification problem with only 2 classes, with the majority class being 95 in the count and the minority class being only 5, the classification model can predict every sample to be classified as majority class and still get an accuracy of 95%. That is why the class imbalance problem has to be rectified before training the model but first we clean our data using **Regular Expression** as there are a number of unwanted characters in text data. Regular Expression can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern."
